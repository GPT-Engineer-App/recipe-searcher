# recipe-searcher

1. Search and Display Recipes:
Implement a search bar where users can type the name of a recipe.
On entering a search query and pressing the "Search" button, display a list of recipes that
match the query. Each recipe should display a title and a brief description.
2. View Recipe Details:
When a user clicks on a recipe title, display the full recipe details, including ingredients,
steps, and an image.
The recipe details should appear in a dedicated section on the same page without
reloading the page.
3. Interactive Features:
Allow users to mark ingredients as "purchased" by clicking on them. Purchased
ingredients should be visually distinguished (e.g., strikethrough text or change in color).
Provide a "Print Recipe" button that, when clicked, opens the print dialog for the current
recipe details usinf html and css with javascript
